[TABLE] PRODUCTION WORK INSTRUCTION Section : TPL/WI/P/15 Issue/Rev.No. : 02/01 Date : 03-09-2025 Page : 1 of 2 INNER EXTRUSION [/TABLE] As advised by production shift In-charge, verify the route card and draw the required compound, conductor and master batch from RM stores. Set the extrusion machine temperatures as per TPL/TD/28 (These temp. are only for reference, it may vary from time to time and batch to batch). Fix the Element bobbin on pay off and take the cable end and pass through the routed wheels and dancer, induction pre-heater, vacuum pipe ( if required) up to cross head. Load the empty bobbin on take up side and attached the sleeve passing from water tub, diameter sensor, capstan, spark tester and take up dancer. Pour the compound in to hopper, NOTE: For PA-6 and master batch, keep the material in oven before extrusion at 75°C for 4 hr and add 2-3% of mater batch during extrusion. Select and fix the die and nozzle (as per the chart -3 displayed on machines) and fix in cross head. Start the machine and check flow of the Compound between the die and nozzle and take the conductor through the nozzle and attached to extension cable run for few maters and check the center. If the center is not satisfactory then change the die and nozzle to get uniform thickness. Check strip force, if it is not OK then re-adjust the process parameters like, water temp., tool setting and line speed. NOTE: Ensure pre-heating of conductor (As per instructions displayed on pre-heater) and vacuum, the insulation over the conductor should not be too loose or too tight. Switch on the water circulation pump to flow water in channel. NOTE: For PFA insulation don’t use water . ETFE/ECTFE/FEP - 45±5 deg, XLPE - 50±5 deg NOTE: water circulation for barrel to be “ON” during extrusion Switch on the online spark tester and set the reading 6-7 KV AC. Now slowly increase the line speed and ensure the diameter as per job card and TD. After reaching required diameter, make an insulation cuts with sharp tool, to identify and eliminate setting length. [TABLE] PRODUCTION WORK INSTRUCTION Section : TPL/WI/P/15 Issue/Rev.No. : 02/01 Date : 03-09-2025 Page : 2 of 2 INNER EXTRUSION [/TABLE] Now enter the details in production tabs like, date of production, machine number, customer, cable type, wire size, type of compound, batch number of wire & compound, length, machine setting parameters along with master bobbin number and signature of operator. When the pay off bobbin become empty, then tie up the next production conductor with existing length in advance to avoid machine stoppage. Enter the produced lengths in the production tabs and write the length details in job card (write the length position in job card i.e. Bottom, 2, 3, 4… top), number of spark fails and tie up the route card with cable and send to next operation. Special note on Machine cleaning: Case-A: if the same grade material running continuously, weekly once Case-B: Every time if the same grade material but setting change for different production, Clean the die / nozzle and cross head area. Case-C: if the material grade change, then totally clean the machine. [TABLE] Do’s Do Not’s Check spark tester “ON” during production. Don’t produce without spark test Select suitable die nozzles Don’t use same nozzle for different sizes Use only standard tools for cleaning Don’t use sharp blades for cleaning Check center for every joint Don’t run without checking center Select suitable take up bobbin Don’t produce up to outer edge of bobbin Check job card for required compound Don’t produce without referring job card by assumption. Stop water flow when machine is idle Don’t forget to switch off water flow when no production / machine cleaning Adjust the cone length at die face by adjusting vacuum pressure Don’t run the extrusion at any point if set temperature is not achieved Ensure extruder and capstan in synchronous speed Don’t produce cable more than bobbin sides Whenever material change clean the machine properly Don’t run production without air wiper [/TABLE]
